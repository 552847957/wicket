NOTE - According to http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt ':' is not a valid
       character in URL and must be encoded. 
       In order for Wicket to produce valid URLs I've decided to use - as separator instead
       This will only affect listener URLs anyway, which are not shown in location bar 
       (except for bookmarkable listeners on stateless pages)
       '-' in component name is encoded as '--'.


NOT BOOKMARKABLE
----------------

Page Instance - Render (RenderPageRequestHandler)
/wicket/page?2
/wicket/page?2.4
/wicket/page?abc.2.4

Page Instance - Listener (ListenerInterfaceRequestHandler)
/wicket/page?2-click-foo-bar-baz
/wicket/page?2.4-click-foo-bar-baz
/wicket/page?pageMap.2.4-click-foo-bar-baz
/wicket/page?2.4-click.1-foo-bar-baz (1 is behavior index)  

BOOKMARKABLE - NOT MOUNTED
--------------------------

Page Class - Render (BookmarkablePageRequestHandler)
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?pageMap
(these will redirect to hybrid alternative if page is not stateless)

Page Instance - Render Hybrid (RenderPageRequestHandler for pages that were created using bookmarkable URLs)
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?2
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?2.4
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?pageMap.2.4

Page Instance - Bookmarkable Listener (BookmarkableListenerInterfaceRequestHandler)
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?2-click-foo-bar-baz
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?2.4-click-foo-bar-baz
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?pageMap.2.4-click-foo-bar-baz
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?2.4-click.1-foo-bar-baz (1 is behavior index)
(these will redirect to hybrid if page is not stateless)

BOOKMARKABLE - MOUNTED
----------------------

Page Class - Render (BookmarkablePageRequestHandler for mounted pages)
/mount/point
/mount/point?pageMap
(these will redirect to hybrid alternative if page is not stateless)

Page Instance - Render Hybrid (RenderPageRequestHandler for mounted pages) 
/mount/point?2
/mount/point?2.4
/mount/point?pageMap.2.4

Page Instance - Bookmarkable Listener (BookmarkableListenerInterfaceRequestHandler for mounted pages) 
/mount/point?2-click-foo-bar-baz
/mount/point?2.4-click-foo-bar-baz
/mount/point?pageMap.2.4-click-foo-bar-baz
/mount/point?2.4-click.1-foo-bar-baz (1 is behavior index)
(these will redirect to hybrid if page is not stateless)

mount path can also contain parameter placeholders
e.g. when mount path is /foo/${bar}/baz and the incomming url is /foo/abc/baz   the extracted page parameters will 
contain named parameter bar="abc".
