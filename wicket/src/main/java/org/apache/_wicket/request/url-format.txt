NOTE - According to http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt ':' is not a valid
       character in URL and must be encoded. 
       In order for Wicket to produce valid URLs I've decided to use - as separator instead
       This will only affect listener URLs anyway, which are not shown in location bar 
       (except for bookmarkable listeners on stateless pages)


NOT BOOKMARKABLE
----------------

Page Instance - Render
/wicket/page?2
/wicket/page?2.4
/wicket/page?abc.2.4

Page Instance - Listener
/wicket/page?2-click-foo-bar-baz
/wicket/page?2.4-click-foo-bar-baz
/wicket/page?pageMap.2.4-click-foo-bar-baz

BOOKMARKABLE - NOT MOUNTED
--------------------------

Page Instance - Render
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?pageMap
(these will redirect to hybrid alternative if page is not stateless)

Page Instance - Render Hybrid 
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?2
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?2.4
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?pageMap.2.4

Page Instance - Bookmarkable Listener 
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?2-click-foo-bar-baz
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?2.4-click-foo-bar-baz
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?pageMap.2.4-click-foo-bar-baz
(these will redirect to hybrid if page is not stateless)

BOOKMARKABLE - MOUNTED
----------------------

Page Instance - Render
/mount/point
/mount/point?pageMap
(these will redirect to hybrid alternative if page is not stateless)

Page Instance - Render Hybrid 
/mount/point?2
/mount/point?2.4
/mount/point?pageMap.2.4

Page instance - Bookmarkable Listener 
/mount/point?2-click-foo-bar-baz
/mount/point?2.4-click-foo-bar-baz
/mount/point?pageMap.2.4-click-foo-bar-baz
(these will redirect to hybrid if page is not stateless)
