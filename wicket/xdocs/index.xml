		<section name="Welcome to Wicket">
			<p>
				Wicket is a Java web application framework that takes
				simplicity, separation of concerns and ease of
				development to a whole new level. Wicket pages can be
				mocked up, previewed and later revised using standard
				WYSIWYG HTML design tools. Dynamic content processing
				and form handling is all handled in Java code using a
				first-class component model backed by POJO data beans
				that can easily be persisted using your favourite
				technology.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>NB.</strong>
				this is the documentation of a fixed release. The latest
				and greatest of Wicket can be found at our
				<a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net">
					main project page

				name="August 29, 2005 - Maintenance release Wicket 1.0.3 available">
				<p>
					A minor bugfix release has been issued for PageableListViewNavigation.
					The 1.0.3 version doesn't have any other improvements or fixes.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are using Wicket 1.0 and use the <code>PageableListViewNavigation</code> or
					the <code>PageableListViewNavigator</code>, then we advise you to upgrade to this
					version. Note that when you upgrade from 1.0.1, you may experience some backwards
					incompatibilities, as outlined in the 1.0.2 release notes.
				</p>

			<subsection
				name="August 22, 2005 - Maintenance release Wicket 1.0.2 available">
				<p>
					The Wicket development team has released the second
					maintenance release of the Wicket 1.0 branch. This
					release fixes some bugs, and with that introduces
					one <strong>API breaking change</strong>:
					<ul>
						<li>
							newChoiceItem does not use object parameter
							but selects directly from list Issue:
							1263892. Thanks to Arjan Zwaan.
						</li>
						<li>
							Backport: AbstractDetachableModel doesn't
							propogate attach/detach Issue: 1253113.
						</li>
						<li>
							Backport: serialization bug in
							LocalizedImageResource
						</li>
						<li>
							Backport: possible NullPointerException in
							DynamicImageResource.getResourceStream()
						</li>
						<li>
							Backport: catch if session is saved to disk
							and reloaded again but locale is changed
						</li>
						<li>
							fix for classloading problems that caused
							problems loading markup/ resources for
							components that were loaded by another
							classloader than the current one.
						</li>
						<li>
							Backport: closed FileOutputStream in
							wicket.util.file.Files in finally block
						</li>
					</ul>
					The API change involves the <code>IResourceStreamLocator</code>
					interface, where the <code>locate</code> method now takes a
					<code>ClassLoader</code> as an extra parameter. Passing in <code>null</code>
					will use the context classloader.
				</p>
				<p>
					So while this is a maintenance release, <em>please make sure your code
					still compiles with this release.</em>
				</p>

			<subsection
				name="Juli 17, 2005 - Maintenance release Wicket 1.0.1 available">
				<p>
					The Wicket development team has released the first
					(and probably last) maintenance release of Wicket
					1.0. This release fixes some bugs and adds some
					missing functionality:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Only validate components that are visible
						</li>
						<li>
							FeedbackPanel: made some methods that were
							not meant for overriding final, and added
							methods that make extending feedbackpanel
							easier
						</li>
						<li>
							fixed bug in AbstractPropertyModel which
							gave problems using custom converters
							(overriding getConverter for a component)
							with compound property models
						</li>
						<li>
							ComponentStringResourceLoader: resources are
							now inherited from parent classes when
							components have been subclassed
						</li>
					</ul>
					Enjoy!
